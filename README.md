# C# Integer Overflow and Exception Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common C# programming error involving potential integer overflow and inadequate exception handling. The `MyClass.cs` file contains the buggy code, while `MyClassSolution.cs` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The `MyMethod` function in `MyClass.cs` performs integer division.  It correctly handles division by zero, but fails to address the potential for integer overflow if the result of the division is larger than `int.MaxValue`. This can lead to unexpected and incorrect results.  Furthermore, the function doesn't handle potential exceptions gracefully. 

## Solution

The `MyClassSolution.cs` file demonstrates a corrected implementation. This solution addresses both issues:

1. **Integer Overflow:** It uses checked arithmetic to detect and throw an exception if an overflow occurs.
2. **Exception Handling:** The solution includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions and provide more informative error messages.

This example highlights the importance of considering potential arithmetic overflows and implementing robust exception handling in C# applications.
